# Hello people of the World Wide Web!:vulcan_salute:
## About Me :boy:
:loud_sound: My name is SDF, or you can just call me Lex, I am a **Junior Web Developer** (that specializes in **Back-End Development**, learning to be a **Full-Stack Developer**) and currently a **3rd year in High School**.  

:man_technologist: I began my journey on Web Development , during that period I studied **PHP, Laravel, Vue, SQL, and basic HTML CSS**. For the future I'm very interested in learning **Javascript, Node, Express, and NEXT**, there's just something very exciting about learning new technologies.

:video_game: Beside coding, I **love** playing video games, easy ones, hard ones, or even just casual ones, you name it! But the one thing that I really want to be really good at is **Game Development** itself, since I was a kid I had this goal where I wanted to make a game that many people can enjoy, I made some simple games in **Scratch** and I **really** enjoyed it, so why not crank it up and just start with **Unity or Unreal**, but it's not possible yet, you'll see why when you read what my laptop says :
> - Bro I can't even open visual studio and unity without loading for 15 minutes
> - Yo why are you opening 2 VSCode windows at once! Are you insane?
</br>
And that's basically me, a person who's end path is still much much much further away :rocket:
