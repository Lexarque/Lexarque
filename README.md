# Hello people of the World Wide Web!:vulcan_salute:
## About Me :boy:
:loud_sound: My name is SDF, or you can just call me Lex, I am a **Junior Web Developer** (that specializes in **Back-End Development**, learning to be a **Full-Stack Developer**).  

:man_technologist: I began my journey on Web Development in mid **October 2021**, during that period I studied **PHP, Laravel, Vue, SQL, and basic HTML CSS**. For the future I'm very interested in learning **Javascript and it's frameworks**, there's just something very exciting about learning new technologies.

:video_game: Beside coding, I **love** playing video games, easy ones, hard ones, or even just casual ones, you name it! But the one thing that I really want to be really good at is **Game Development** itself, since I was a kid I had this goal where I wanted to make a game that many people can enjoy, I made some simple games in **Scratch** and I **really** enjoyed it
</br></br>
And that's basically me, a person who's journey is still much much much further away :rocket:
